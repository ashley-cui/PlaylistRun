Prototype Deliverable

A document explaining why you chose the technology stack that you are
demonstrating; I’d like to know if you considered other stacks, and the process you
used to choose the stack for the prototype. The doc should be added to your ‘docs’
folder on github.

Why flask?
Flask is a lightweight framework that is easy for everyone in our group to pick up.
Many group members have prior experience with flask. There are many boilerplate code
and template available and it's fast for us to get a simple prototype up and running.

Have we considered other stacks?
We have considered Javascript/Node.js for the backend server. However, most of us seem to more familiar
with Python. Since Scalability/ Performance isn't really too much of an issue for this project, we decided
to stick with Flask.
